	* src/{?}-network.c: network_get_image
		the system was using the basename of friends avatar urls for
		the name of the images that were being saved.  So I've added
		the friend's profile id as a prefix of the image name. I also
		changed it so that all image strings are automatically null
		terminated so the old checks were safly removed to improve
		efficancy.

	* src/{?}-parser.c & src/{?}-send-message-dialog.c:
		I removed unneeded #includes.

	* ./*: forked from {?}.
		The changes below where submitted but most where not accepted
		& again the fact that I'm an artist & those programming are
		standard ignorant, arogant, engineer wanna be types.
		
		~shrug~ oh well I've learned my final lessons about wanting to
		join & contribute to existing OSS projects & the open source
		community.

	* directories: ./.svn, ./src/.svn, ./lib{?}/.svn, ./data/.svn,
	./data/glade/.svn, ./po/.svn, ./help/.svn, ./help/C/.svn
		All subversion trails are now removed.  I have to fork but I
		merge in others code especially if mine is unwanted.
	
	* src/{?}-app.c: removed unused objects.
		There were 3 methods where priv objects were being defined and
		initialized but never used.  So that's gone.

	* src/{?}-network.c: {?}_network_sort_users
		I have added this so lists of friends and followers are now
		sorted alphabetically so friends can easily be found when
		sending direct messages or viewing their status.
	
	* src/{?}-network.c: {?}_network_make_users_list
				& network_cb_on_users
		Both methods now sort the GList they create by calling the
		above method, {?}_network_sort_users, using GTK's
		g_list_sort method.

	* src/{?}-parser.c: {?}_parser_timeline
		I changed what is saved in the GtkListStore so that the user
		preference for displaying user name vs screen name effects
		what is displayed when the tweet is expanded so now the same
		is shown in the timeline and expanded message.

2009-02-26  Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>

	* src/{?}-lists-dialog.c: {?}_lists_dialog_show
		As I mentioned in my previous ChangeLog entry about this
		method it was not setting & resetting the dialog's WATCH
		cursor.  I have now fixed it so that it locks the dialog until
		the list loads & than resets the pointer.  It now works by
		locking the dialog, setting the busy cursor, displaying and/or
		loading the list, than resetting the cursor and re-enabling
		the window.

	* src/{?}-send-message-dialog.c: message_setup
		I stopped this method from setting focus when loading the
		dialog so the correct focus can be set depending on whether a
		"What are you doing?" status update or direct messaging is
		being sent.
	
	* src/{?}-send-message-dialog.c: {?}_message_show_friends
		I optimized this method and its code so its much easier to
		read & understand what is going on.  More over I have added
		calls to 'gtk_widget_grab_focus' so that when a status update
		is being typed then the textview is auto-focused.  When a
		direct message is being sent than the drop-down list of
		friends recieves focus by default.

	* src/{?}-network.c:	rewrote: {?}_network_get_friends &
		{?}_network_get_followers.
		created make_users_list.
		
		I have fixed Twitux so it now loads all of the user's
		friends/followers for when sending a direct message or when
		selecting to view a specific friends statuses.
		
	* src/{?}-lists-dialog.c: {?}_lists_dialog_show
		I removed the code that was changing the cursor to a busy
		cursor.  It was disabling the friends list only after friends
		list was loaded.  so they'd all appear there but could not be
		clicked on. The window would have to be closed than re-opened
		to actually access all friends.

	* po/Makefile.in: PO_LINGUAS & USER_LINGUAS 
		I added export GREP_OPTIONS=""; to both shell execs so it
		actually finds files in the format it expects.
	
	* data/Makefile.in: {?}.desktop
		changed:
		{?}.desktop.in: $(top_builddir)/config.status $(srcdir)/{?}.desktop.in.in
		to
		{?}.desktop: $(top_builddir)/config.status $(srcdir)/{?}.desktop.in
	
	* help/{?}-omf.in: depricated.

2009-02-11  Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>

	* configure: ac_config_files
		I modified them so they look for 'po/Makefile' and
		'data/{?}.desktop' correctly an will fall back to the
		correct '.in' when needed.

	* po/Makefile.in: clean & dist distdirs
		I corrected the sh commands that find gettext .po, .gmo, & etc
		files.  Now po/Makefile's clean & beyond will now work.  Most
		importantly make clean will now work.
	
	* po/POFILES: {?}.desktop.in.in
	* po/POFILES.in: {?}.desktop.in.in
		These were both referencing {?}.desktop.in.in which was
		only a duplicate of {?}.desktop.in.  They now correctly
		look for {?}.desktop.in

	* data/Makefile.am: .PRECIOUS: Makefile and multiple varibles
	* data/Makefile.in: .PRECIOUS: Makefile and multiple varibles
		I changed references to Makefile.in.in &
		{?}-desktop.in.in to point to Makefile.in &
		{?}.desktop.in respectfully.  I also removed the unnead
		'.in.in' files.

2009-02-09  Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>

	* src/{?}-app.c: {?}_app_set_image & {?}_app_expand_message
	* src/{?}-tweet-list.c: tweet_list_changed_cb
		I plugged some large memory leaks by unreferencing
		GdkPixbuf(s) & various other gobjects used my Twitux for
		Twitter's avatars.

2009-02-06  Kaity G. B. <uberChick@uberChicGeekChick.Com>

	* src/{?}-app.c: {?}_app_set_image & {?}_app_expand_message
	* src/{?}-tweet-list.c: tweet_list_setup_view
		I wrote resizing code to stop large images from bloating
		Twitux's tweet list.  I have also added code to keep the
		tweet list avatar column at a fixed width.

[previous notes on where {?} came from can be found in Twitux's changelog,
Twitux is the project {?} was forked from.  Why {?} was forked can be read at:
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/index.php?func=detail&aid=2648731&group_id=198704&atid=966544
which is what happened when I tried to submit my 2nd patch to the orginal
project.]
